## Introduction

Hi Everyone :wave:, this is Vishnu Nandakumar. I am a beginner to this developer world and with each day I like and love to learn and contribute to this evergrowing communitiy.
I have gained some experience in the field of Machine learning and Software development, currently working as a product manager in a reputed firm in my country. Since, I 
always love to get my hands dirty whenever I get time. If you like my work, I humbly request you drop a follow and a :star2: on the repository that you loved. As always, 
all the best in whatever you are pursuing :heart_eyes:.
